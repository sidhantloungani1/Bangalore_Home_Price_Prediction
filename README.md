Bangalore Home Price Prediction
Developed a comprehensive machine learning project to predict home prices in Bangalore using a Kaggle dataset. 

The project involved:
Data Preprocessing: Loaded and cleaned the dataset, performed outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction to enhance model performance.
Model Development: Built and optimized ML models using Scikit-learn, employing techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation for model validation.
Visualization & Tools: Used Matplotlib for data visualization and exploratory analysis. Worked in Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm for development.
Web Application: Designed an interactive web app for client-side operations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Server Integration: Deployed the ML model on a Python Flask-based HTTP server, enabling seamless integration between the backend and frontend.
