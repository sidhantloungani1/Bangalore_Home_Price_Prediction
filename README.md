This is a hands-on machine learning project where I focused on predicting home prices in Bangalore using a dataset from Kaggle. The project involved exploring the data, cleaning it to remove inconsistencies, engineering meaningful features, and building a predictive model to deliver accurate price estimates. 

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset, performed outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction to enhance model performance.
2. Built and optimized ML models using Scikit-learn, employing techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and K-Fold Cross-Validation for model validation.
3. Used Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization and exploratory analysis. Worked in Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm for development.
4. Designed an interactive web app for client-side operations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. Deployed the ML model on a Python Flask-based HTTP server, enabling seamless integration between the backend and frontend.
